Evaluate a user's reputation and influence on a social network using d-core decomposition

The engulfing presence of Social Media has made numerous platforms available for the public to voice their opinions and thoughts. Twitter is one such social media platform, where like-minded people can follow someoneâ€™s content, which makes the person popular. User interaction on twitter can heavily depend on multiple metrics like popularity, based on the activity of that user. To provide a basis of its analysis, we measured and evaluated the relationship between popularity, social influence and reputation of a user in their social network. We processed information of almost 12000 users, and measures reputation based on D-core decomposition. It helped us deduce a weak uphill relationship between the popularity and the reputation of a user. Additionally, a reputed user in the network was unlikely to be a popular user of the network

The code used for analysis has been provided here, and the analysis results partially support our hypothesis.
